# Basic Boilerplate

A stripped-down version of a research project I'm working on that I'd like to use as a boilerplate. Thx to Joel Sequiera (@joelseq) for the help!

## Setup

* Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
* Inside the main directory of the project, run `yarn`

Go ahead and run
```bash
$ yarn start:dev
```

To start devving!! :)

## Development

* `yarn start:dev` - to start local development server with nodemon and hot reloading.
* `yarn test` - to run unit tests.
* `yarn lint` - to run linter.
* `yarn build` - to build production files
* `yarn start:prod` - to start the server in production mode
* `yarn bs` - to build production files and start server in production mode (combination of above two steps).
